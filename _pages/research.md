My research lies at the intersection of **optimization**, **machine learning**, and **scientific computing**. 
I am interested in designing theoretically grounded and computationally efficient algorithms for large-scale problems arising in data science, networked systems, and scientific modeling. 
Below are several major directions of my current and past work.

## Distributed Optimization Algorithms
Distributed optimization aims to solve large-scale problems collaboratively across multiple computing agents or data centers, with or without central coordination. 
My research explores both **centralized** and **decentralized** settings, emphasizing **communication-efficient** and **computation-efficient** algorithm design. 
I have developed several accelerated and provably convergent methods for decentralized gradient tracking, compressed communication, and directed network topologies—bridging theory and implementation in large-scale learning and signal processing systems.

  This presentation introduces key topics including:
  * Non-accelerated algorithms: DGD, EXTRA/PG-EXTRA, NIDS  
  * Accelerated algorithms: OGT (Optimal Gradient Tracking), OPAPC  
  * Compressed communication: LEAD

## Primal–Dual Algorithms
Primal–dual splitting methods are fundamental tools for structured convex and nonconvex optimization. 
I proposed the **PD3O algorithm (Primal–Dual Three-Operator Splitting)**, which unifies and generalizes a family of primal–dual methods. 
My work further explores the **equivalence relationships** among various primal–dual frameworks, providing both mathematical insights and practical algorithms for imaging, inverse problems, and distributed learning.

  * PD3O, Condat–Vu, AFBA, PDFP  
  * Chambolle–Pock, PAPC, FDFP2O

## Sparse Optimization and Signal Processing
Sparse modeling provides a powerful framework for recovering signals and images from limited or corrupted data. 
My earlier research contributed advances in **nonconvex regularization**, **robust PCA**, and **low-rank matrix recovery**. 
These works combine optimization theory with practical algorithms for **image reconstruction**, **denoising**, and **compressive sensing**, leading to efficient solvers with provable recovery guarantees.
