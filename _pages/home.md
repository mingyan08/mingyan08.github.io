## Research Overview
My research lies at the intersection of **optimization theory**, **machine learning**, and **scientific computing**. Our goal is to design algorithms that are both **theoretically sound** and **computationally efficient** for large-scale or structure-rich problems that arise in modern data science and engineering applications. See more about my current [Research Topics](/research/) and recent [publications](/publications/).

## Opportunities
I am **recruiting highly motivated PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and visiting students** to join my research group at CUHK-Shenzhen. Preferred backgrounds include mathematics, computer science, or related areas, with strong analytical thinking and solid programming skills.

If you are interested in working on topics such as **optimization**, **machine learning**, or **AI-driven scientific computing**, please refer to the [Join Us](/join_us/) page for application instructions.
