Ming Yan is an **Associate Professor** and **Assistant Dean** in the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). 

He spent **seven years at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**, where he received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in 2005 and 2008. He then spent another **seven years at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** — including a one-year postdoctoral period at Rice University — and obtained his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2012. 

From 2015 to 2022, Ming Yan spent **seven years at Michigan State University (MSU)**, where he was a faculty member in both the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE) and the Department of Mathematics. 

He joined CUHK-Shenzhen in 2022.

## Research Overview
Ming Yan's research lies at the intersection of **optimization theory**, **machine learning**, and **scientific computing**, where mathematics meets modern data-driven discovery. His work focuses on developing algorithms that are both **theoretically grounded** and **computationally efficient**, with applications to large-scale and structure-rich problems arising in science and engineering.

See more about his [research topics](/research/) and recent [publications](/publications/).
