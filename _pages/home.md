Ming Yan is an **Associate Professor** and **Assistant Dean** in the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). 
He spent **seven years at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**, where he received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in 2005 and 2008. He then spent another **seven years at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** — including a one-year postdoctoral period at Rice University — and obtained his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2012. 
From 2015 to 2022, Ming Yan spent **seven years at Michigan State University (MSU)**, where he was a faculty member in both the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE) and the Department of Mathematics. 
He joined CUHK-Shenzhen in 2022.

## Research Overview
My research lies at the intersection of **optimization theory**, **machine learning**, and **scientific computing**. Our goal is to design algorithms that are both **theoretically sound** and **computationally efficient** for large-scale or structure-rich problems that arise in modern data science and engineering applications. See more about my current [Research Topics](/research/) and recent [publications](/publications/).
