## Research Overview
My research lies at the intersection of **optimization theory**, **machine learning**, and **scientific computing**.  
I am particularly interested in developing mathematically grounded algorithms for **AI for Science**, including:

- Optimization and acceleration theory  
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their complex-valued extensions  
- Bregman-distance-based and adaptive accelerated algorithms  
- Decentralized and distributed learning methods  

Our goal is to design algorithms that are both **theoretically sound** and **practically efficient** for large-scale or structure-rich problems arising in modern data science.
